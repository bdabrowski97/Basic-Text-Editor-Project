This was my final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.
----------------------------------------
This is a basic text editor made in JavaFX. It allows you to open,close,edit, and save
existing text files as well as create new ones. It features toggles to view word count,
sentence count, and Flesch score. It also has a basic spelling checker that can be used
with the editor simutaneously. 

It can also make a graph to see how efficient finding the 
word/sentence count and Flesch score of the current text is, comparing the process from
using three seperate loops vs a single loop. Unsurprisingly, the single loop method is faster.
The data collected from these graphs are also printed into the outputData folder.

When opening and closing text files, the program automatically opens the inputData folder
for storing all the text documents.
